From https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/pooling.html
Default pool/overflow size is 5/10, timeout 30 seconds

max_overflow=10 - the number of connections to allow in connection pool “overflow”, that is connections that can be opened above and beyond the pool_size setting, which defaults to five. this is only used with QueuePool.

pool_size=5 - the number of connections to keep open inside the connection pool. This used with QueuePool as well as SingletonThreadPool. With QueuePool, a pool_size setting of 0 indicates no limit; to disable pooling, set poolclass to NullPool instead.

pool_timeout=30 - number of seconds to wait before giving up on getting a connection from the pool. This is only used with QueuePool. This can be a float but is subject to the limitations of Python time functions which may not be reliable in the tens of milliseconds.

pool_recycle=-1 - this setting causes the pool to recycle connections after the given number of seconds has passed. It defaults to -1, or no timeout. For example, setting to 3600 means connections will be recycled after one hour. Note that MySQL in particular will disconnect automatically if no activity is detected on a connection for eight hours (although this is configurable with the MySQLDB connection itself and the server configuration as well).
